Welcome to my C LeetCode Portfolio! This repository showcases my collection of C-based solutions for LeetCode challenges, highlighting my problem-solving skills and proficiency in data structures and algorithms.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode is a popular online platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges and problems, allowing developers to improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. The platform covers various topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find my C solutions for a variety of LeetCode challenges. Each solution is organized into its corresponding problem category, making it easy to navigate and explore different algorithms and approaches. Along with each solution, there is a screenshot showing the acceptance of the solution on the LeetCode platform.

## Why C?

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language that offers a balance between high-level and low-level programming. By solving LeetCode problems in C, I demonstrate my ability to implement efficient algorithms and data structures while managing memory manually.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository. You can use these C implementations as a reference for your own problem-solving journey or as a source of inspiration for your LeetCode practice. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, I hope you find value in this C LeetCode Portfolio.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
